![demo screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thi-ng/umbrella/develop/assets/examples/shader-graph.jpg)

Minimal shader graph setup based on [@thi.ng/webgl](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/webgl), [@thi.ng/shader-ast](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/shader-ast) and [@thi.ng/scenegraph](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/scenegraph).

This project was developed from scratch during the [2nd thi.ng livestream on
Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEC_qbUXDo8). Please see video for
further detailed discussion. The only changes made after the recording were some
updates to the actual 4 shaders.

## Usage

Left click (or touch) on any of the squares to drag them. Right click to rotate.
When clicking + dragging on empty space, the entire canvas contents will be
moved / rotated.

## Building

Please also refer to the [example build
instructions](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/wiki/Example-build-instructions)
on the wiki.
