[Live demo](http://demo.thi.ng/umbrella/gesture-analysis/)

Mouse / touch gesture processing, analysis and SVG visualization, using
[@thi.ng/rstream](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/rstream)
constructs and
[@thi.ng/transducers](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/transducers).

**Note: Currently only really works on desktop until I figured out a way
to better attach touch events...**

Please refer to the [example build
instructions](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/wiki/Example-build-instructions)
on the wiki.

**IMPORTANT:** Please also see the [troubleshooting
note](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/wiki/Example-build-instructions#troubleshooting)
and temporary workaround for this example.
