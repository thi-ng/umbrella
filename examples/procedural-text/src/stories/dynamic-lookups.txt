# given a variable assignment like <hero=name>, we can use dots in the name
# to lookup derived variables with their name based on current value(s)
# 
# (1) assume the assignment of <hero=name> picked value `a`
# (2) now the var lookup <hero.job> will look for a var called `a.job`
# (3) there's only one option for `a.job`, i.e. `astronaut`
# (4) the lookup `hero.job.desc` will then look for `astronaut.desc`
