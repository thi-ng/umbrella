## About

![dataflow graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thi-ng/umbrella/develop/assets/examples/rs-dflow.png)

This example combines the following packages to create & execute the
above dataflow graph in a declarative manner. The diagram generation
itself is part of the example and handled via the @thi.ng/rstream-dot
package.
