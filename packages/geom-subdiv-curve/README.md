## About

Freely customizable, iterative nD subdivision curves for open / closed geometries. This is a support package for [@thi.ng/geom](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/geom).

Based in principle on:

- [Generating subdivision curves with L‚àísystems on a
  GPU](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/subgpu.sig2003.pdf)
- Clojure version [thi.ng/geom-clj](http://thi.ng/geom-clj).

### Available subdivision schemes

The following schemes are available as presets and their effects illustrated.

#### Chaikin subdivision

[`SUBDIV_CHAIKIN`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-subdiv-curve/variables/SUBDIV_CHAIKIN.html) is supported for open & closed geometries.

![SUBDIV_CHAIKIN preset on closed geometry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thi-ng/umbrella/develop/assets/geom-subdiv-curve/subdiv-chaikin-closed.png)

#### Cubic subdivision

[`SUBDIV_CUBIC`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-subdiv-curve/variables/SUBDIV_CUBIC.html)
is only supported for closed geometries (at current).

#### Dyn-Levin-Gregory subdivision

[`SUBDIV_DLG`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-subdiv-curve/variables/SUBDIV_DLG.html)
is only supported for closed geometries (at current).

#### Displacement subdivision

[`SUBDIV_DISPLACE`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-subdiv-curve/variables/SUBDIV_DISPLACE.html) is a higher order, customizable subdivision and supported for open & closed geometries.

![SUBDIV_DISPLACE preset on closed geometry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thi-ng/umbrella/develop/assets/geom-subdiv-curve/subdiv-displace-closed.png)

#### Split at midpoints

[`SUBDIV_MID`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-subdiv-curve/variables/SUBDIV_MID.html) is supported for open & closed geometries.

![SUBDIV_MID preset on closed geometry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thi-ng/umbrella/develop/assets/geom-subdiv-curve/subdiv-mid-closed.png)

#### Split at thirds

[`SUBDIV_THIRDS`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-subdiv-curve/variables/SUBDIV_THIRDS.html) is supported for open & closed geometries.
