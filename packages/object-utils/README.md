## About

Utilities for manipulating plain JS objects & maps.

This package contains functionality which was previously part of and has been
extracted from the [@thi.ng/associative](https://thi.ng/associative) package.

### Features

- Key-value pair inversion for maps and vanilla objects, i.e. swaps `K => V` to `V => K`
- Single or multi-property index generation for maps and objects
- Key selection, renaming, segmenting, splitting, transformations for maps and
  objects
- Deep-merging (destructively & non-destructively) of objects/maps

## Status
