## About

2D grid and shape iterators w/ multiple orderings.

Provides the altogether 25 following orderings (excluding symmetries) to
generate grid coordinates, including iterators for shape rasterization, drawing,
clipping, filling, processing in general:

### Columns

Some functions have been ported from [Christopher
Kulla](https://fpsunflower.github.io/ckulla/)'s Java-based [Sunflow
renderer](https://sunflow.sf.net).

For more basic 2D/3D grid iteration, also see `range2d()` & `range3d()`
in
[@thi.ng/transducers](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/transducers).

### Mirror symmetries & arbitrary coordinate transformations

All of the above mentioned grid iterators support point (grid coordinate)
transformations to create variations of their base orderings. The package
provides the `flipX`, `flipY` and `flipXY` preset transforms to mirror one or
both axes, but custom transforms can be easily implemented via the same
underlying mechanism. These transforms can be specified via the `tx` option
passed to the iterators (see code example further below).

### Flood filling

The `floodFill()` iterator can be used to iterate arbitrary 2D grids using an
user-provided predicate function. The function recursively explores (in a
row-major manner) the space in the `[0,0]..(width,height)` interval, starting at
given `x,y` and continues as long given predicate function returns a truthy
value. Any eligible 90-degree connected regions will be found and iterated
recursively. The predicate function is used to select eligible grid cells
(e.g. "pixels" of sorts).

```ts
import { floodFill } from "@thi.ng/grid-iterators";

// source "image"
const img = [
    "█", " ", " ", " ", "█",
    "█", " ", "█", " ", " ",
    " ", " ", "█", " ", "█",
    " ", "█", "█", " ", " ",
    " ", " ", " ", "█", "█",
];

// flood fill iterator from point (1,0)
// only accept " " as source pixel value
// image size is 5x5
const region = floodFill((x, y) => img[x + y * 5] === " ", 1, 0, 5, 5);

// label filled pixels using increasing ASCII values
let ascii = 65; // "A"
for(let [x,y] of region) img[x + y * 5] = String.fromCharCode(ascii++);

// result image showing fill order
img
// [
//   "█", "A", "B", "C", "█",
//   "█", "I", "█", "D", "E",
//   "K", "J", "█", "F", "█",
//   "L", "█", "█", "G", "H",
//   "M", "N", "O", "█", "█"
// ]
```

### Shape iterators

Additionally, the following shape iterators are available, all also with
optional clipping:

- [circle](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/grid-iterators/src/circle.ts) (Bresenham)
- [hline](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/grid-iterators/src/hvline.ts)
- [vline](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/grid-iterators/src/hvline.ts)
- [line](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/grid-iterators/src/line.ts) (Bresenham)

//   [ 3, 3 ], [ 2, 3 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 0, 3 ]
// ]

// with applied horizontal mirroring
// also, if `rows` is missing, it defaults to same value as `cols`

// [
//   [ 3, 0 ], [ 2, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ],
