# [9.0.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/@thi.ng/transducers@9.0.0) (2024-04-08)

#### üõë Breaking changes

- update Reducer, Transducer and other types ([95c43f3](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/95c43f3))
- BREAKING CHANGE: update generics in Reducer, Transducer and other types
  - swap generic type args in `Reducer` and `IReducible` to be same order as in `Transducer`, `IXform`,
    i.e. `Reducer<A, B>` maps items from type A to type B, **not** the other way (as was)!
  - this new order is more logical, less confusing and also in line with upcoming async transducers pkg
  - changes in userland should be minimal (if any), only impacted are custom reducer definitions
  - update all pkg internal occurrences
  - various other small refactorings, type/arg updates, e.g.
    - add generics for `reduced()`/`ensureReduced()`/`unreduced()`
    - update `step()` return type (incl. undefined)
    - add `StructField` generics
