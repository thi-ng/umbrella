## About

Optimized 2d/3d/4d and arbitrary length vector operations, support for memory mapping/layouts.

Likely the most comprehensive vector library for TypeScript / JavaScript
currently available.

This package provides **almost 900(!) functions** and supporting types to
perform vector operations on fixed and arbitrary-length vectors, both packed and
strided (i.e. where individual vector components are not successive array
elements, for example in [SOA memory
layouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA)).

Includes componentwise logic operations for boolean vectors, componentwise
comparisons for numeric vectors and componentwise binary ops for signed &
unsigned integer vectors.

### Features

- The vast majority of operations are templated via higher-order functions with
  fixed-sized 2D/3D/4D versions being loop-free. Minified + gzipped, the entire
  package is ~15KB (though most projects will likely use only a small subset of
  the provided functions).
- Unified API: Any `ArrayLike` type can be used as vector containers (e.g. JS
  arrays, typed arrays, custom vector classes). Most functions are implemented
  as multi-methods, dispatching to any potentially optimized versions based on
  given vector arguments.
- Highly modular & tree-shakeable: Each function is defined in its own
  submodule/file. In addition to each generic multi-method base function, all
  fixed-length optimized versions are exported too. E.g. If
  [`add`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/vectors/src/add.ts)
  performs vector addition on arbitrary-length vectors, `add2`, `add3`, `add4`
  are the optimized version for fixed-length vectors...
- Pluggable interface: The [`VecAPI`
  interface](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/vectors/interfaces/VecAPI.html)
  defines objects with the ~70 most common vector operations implemented for
  specific vector sizes. Using this interface simplifies performance-critical
  use cases & algorithms which target different dimensions (e.g. 2D/3D), but
  should use the avaiable size-optimized vector ops. See
  [`VEC2`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/vectors/src/vec2-api.ts),
  [`VEC3`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/vectors/src/vec3-api.ts)
  and
  [`VEC4`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/vectors/src/vec4-api.ts)
- Extensible: Custom vector ops can be defined in a similar manner using the
  provided code templating helpers (see
  [`vop()`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/vectors/src/vop.ts)
  and various `defOpXXX()` functions, e.g.
  [`defOpV()`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/vectors/src/defopv.ts)).
- Immutable by default: Each operation producing a vector result takes an output
  vector as first argument. If `null`, the vector given as 2nd argument will
  (usually) be used as output (i.e. for mutation).
- Strided vector support is handled via the lightweight
  [`Vec2/3/4`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/vectors/src/vec2.ts)
  class wrappers and the
  [`gvec()`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/vectors/src/gvec.ts)
  proxy (for generic, arbitrary-length vectors). These types behave like normal
  arrays (for read/write operations) and are also iterable. A subset of
  functions (suffixed with `S`, e.g.
  [`addS`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/vectors/src/adds.ts)
  vs. `add`) also support striding without the need for extra class wrappers.
  This is handled via additional index and stride arguments for each
  input/output vector. These functions are _mostly_ only available for sizes 2 /
  3 / 4, though. Example: [SOA-ECS](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/examples/soa-ecs)
- Random vector functions support the `IRandom` interface defined by
  [@thi.ng/random](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/random)
  to work with custom (P)RNGs. If omitted, the built-in `Math.random()` will be
  used.

Partially ported from [thi.ng/geom-clj](http://thi.ng/geom-clj) (Clojure) and
[c.thi.ng](http://c.thi.ng) (C11).

### Breaking changes in v8.0.0

Due to an increase of web security measures, many websites are implementing
strict(er) [Content Security
Policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP)
including `default-src` or `script-src` directives. These directives disallow
usage of any dynamic code generation, as it was _heavily_ utilized by this
package in earlier versions. To allow this package being used in such
environments, a complete rewrite was undertaken, replacing code generation with
code templating via higher-order functions.

To the user, most of these underlying changes are invisible with the exception
of some other refactoring, renaming & restructuring:

- `atan` functions are now called `atan_2`, `atan_3`, `atan_4`
- `atan2` functions are now called `atan2_2`, `atan2_3`, `atan2_4`
- `exp` functions are now called `exp_2`, `exp_3`, `exp_4`
- `exp2` (aka `2^x`) functions are now called `exp2_2`, `exp2_3`, `exp2_4`
- `log` functions are now called `log_2`, `log_3`, `log_4`
- `log2` functions are now called `log2_2`, `log2_3`, `log2_4`

The former code generator functionality has been removed and replaced with a set
of higher-order templating functions. There're many variations of function
template families (one family per operation type/signature), all of which are
prefixed with `defOpXXX`. See relevant files in the [/src]() directory... (Also
note: If you want to use these template functions/submodules for your own custom
vector ops — they are _not_ exposed via package-level imports and need to be
imported directly!)

Other structural changes (only relevant when _not_ using package-level imports):
Some source files have been broken up to be more granular. Not listing them here
for brevity. Please consult source code (or submit an issue) if an existing
import doesn't work anymore.

## API

[Generated API docs](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/vectors/)

### Basic usage

```ts
import * as v from "@thi.ng/vectors";

// immutable vector addition (1st arg is result)
v.add([], [1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 30, 40]);
// [11, 22, 33, 44]

// mutable addition
// (if first arg (output) is null writes result to 2nd arg)
a = [1, 2, 3];
v.add(null, a, a);
// [2, 4, 6]

// multiply-add (o = a * b + c)
v.madd([], [10, 20], [0.5, 0.25], [1, 2]);
// [6, 7]

// multiply-add w/ scalar (o = a * n + b)
v.maddN([], [10, 20], 0.5, [1, 2]);
// [6, 12]

// scalar addition w/ arbitrary length & strided vector
v.addN([], gvec([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], 3, 1, 4), 10);
// [11, 12, 13]

// or operate on raw arrays directly...
// here the last 4 args define:
// out index, src index, out stride, src stride
v.addNS3(null, [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], 10, 1, 1, 4, 4)
// [0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 13, 0, 0, 0]

v.dist([1, 2], [100, 200]);
// 221.37072977247917

v.distManhattan([1, 2], [100, 200]);
// 297

v.distChebyshev([1, 2], [100, 200]);
// 198

v.mixN([], [1, 2], [10, 20], 0.5);
// [5.5, 11]

v.fromHomogeneous([], [100, 200, 0.5]);
// [200, 400]

v.swizzle4([], [1, 2], 1, 1, 0, 0);
// [ 2, 2, 1, 1 ]

v.hash([1, 2, 3])
// 2383338936
```

Using the
[`VecAPI`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/vectors/interfaces/VecAPI.html)
implementation objects to use size-optimized vector ops in a pluggable manner
(this is in addition/alternative to using the standard set of polymorphic
functions for similar results).

```ts
import { VEC2, VEC3, type Vec, type VecAPI } from "@thi.ng/vectors";

interface Particle {
    pos: Vec;
    dir: Vec;
    targetDir: Vec;
    speed: number;
    turnSpeed: number;
}

const updateParticle = (p: Particle, { maddN, mixN, normalize }: VecAPI) => {
    // interpolate current direction toward target dir
    mixN(null, p.dir, p.targetDir, p.turnSpeed);
    // normalize direction
    normalize(null, p.dir);
    // add scaled direction to position (and store as new position)
    return maddN(p.pos, p.dir, p.speed, p.pos);
};

// 2d version
let p2d: Particle = {
    pos: [10, 20], dir: [0, 1], targetDir: [1, 0], speed: 5, turnSpeed: 0.1,
};

updateParticle(p2d, VEC2);
// [ 10.552, 24.969 ]

// 3d version
let p3d: Particle = {
    pos: [10, 20, 30], dir: [0, 1, 0], targetDir: [0, 0, 1], speed: 5, turnSpeed: 0.1,
};

updateParticle(p3d, VEC3);
// [ 10, 24.969, 30.552 ]
```

### Naming conventions

Wherever possible, each operation comes in different variations. All fixed size
versions use optimized, loop-free implementations.
