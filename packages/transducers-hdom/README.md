## About

This package provides a single `updateDOM` function, a side-effecting &
stateful transducer which receives
[@thi.ng/hdom](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/master/packages/hdom)
component trees, diffs each against the previous value and applies any
required changes to the browser DOM, starting at given root element. By
default, incoming values are first normalized using @thi.ng/hdom's
`normalizeTree()` function. See [hdom's `start()`
function](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/master/packages/hdom#start)
for more details.

If the `hydrate` option is given, the first received tree is only used
to inject event listeners and initialize components with lifecycle
`init()` methods and expects an otherwise identical pre-existing DOM.
All succeeding trees are diffed then as usual.

This transducer is primarily intended for
[@thi.ng/rstream](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/master/packages/rstream)-based
dataflow graphs, where it can be used as final leaf subscription /
stream transformer to reflect UI changes back to the user, without using
the usual RAF update loop used by @thi.ng/hdom by default. In this
setup, DOM updates will only be performed if the stream this transducer
is attached to receives new values (i.e. hdom component trees).

Please also see the following hdom references for further details:

## Usage examples

The below example is also available in the

directory.

[Live demo](https://demo.thi.ng/umbrella/transducers-hdom/)

```ts
import * as rs from "@thi.ng/rstream";
import * as tx from "@thi.ng/transducers";
import { updateDOM } from "@thi.ng/transducers-hdom";

// root component function
const app = ({ ticks, clicks }) =>
    ["div",
        `${ticks} ticks and `,
        ["a",
            { href: "#", onclick: () => clickStream.next(0) },
            `${clicks} clicks`]
    ];

// click stream (click counter)
const clickStream = new rs.Stream().transform(tx.scan(tx.count(-1)));

// stream combinator
rs.sync({
    src: {
        ticks: rs.fromInterval(1000),
        clicks: clickStream,
    },
    reset: false,
}).transform(
    // transform into hdom component
    tx.map(app),
    // apply as DOM
    updateDOM({ root: document.body })
);

// kick off
clickStream.next(0);
```
