## About

TypedArray-based sparse set implementations with extended ES Set API.

This package contains functionality which was previously part of and has been
extracted from the [@thi.ng/associative](https://thi.ng/associative) package.

### SparseSet8/16/32

[Sparse sets](https://research.swtch.com/sparse) provide super fast
(approx. 4x faster than the native `Set` impl) insertion & lookups for
numeric values in the interval `[0..n)` . The implementation in this
package provides most of the ES6 Set API and internally relies on 2 uint
typed arrays, with the actual backing type dependent on `n`.

Furthermore, unless (or until) values are being removed from the set,
they retain their original insertion order. For some use cases (e.g.
deduplication of values), this property can be very useful.

```ts
import { defSparseSet } from "@thi.ng/sparse-set";

// create sparse set for value range 0 - 99 (uint8 backed)
const a = defSparseSet(100);
a.into([99, 42, 66, 23, 66, 42]);
// SparseSet8 { 99, 42, 66, 23 }

a.has(66)
// true

// sparse sets are iterable
[...a]
// [ 99, 42, 66, 23 ]

// attempting to add out-of-range values will fail
a.add(100)
// SparseSet8 { 99, 42, 66, 23 }

// create sparse set for 16 bit value range 0 - 0xffff (uint16 backed)
const b = defSparseSet(0x10000);
// SparseSet16 {}
```
