## About

IGES 5.3 serializer for (currently only) polygonal geometry, both open & closed.

Mainly intended for exporting geometry to be used in various CAD
applications (e.g. Rhino, Houdini, Fusion 360)

## API

[Generated API docs](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/iges/)

```ts
import * as iges from "@thi.ng/iges";

const doc = iges.newDocument({
    maxCoord: 100,
    precision: 3,
    author: "toxi",
    authorOrg: "thi.ng",
});

doc.start = [
    "Example file for @thi.ng/iges",
    "Defines single open 2D polyline (type 106)"
];

iges.addPolyline(doc, [
    [0,0],
    [0, 100],
    [50, 150],
    [100, 100],
    [0, 100],
    [100, 0],
    [0, 0],
    [100, 100],
    [100, 0]
]);

console.log(iges.serialize(doc));
```

Resulting output (IGES is a text file format):
