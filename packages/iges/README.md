## Installation

```bash
yarn add @thi.ng/iges
```

## Usage examples

```ts
import * as iges from "@thi.ng/iges";

const doc = iges.newDocument({
    maxCoord: 100,
    precision: 3,
    author: "toxi",
    authorOrg: "thi.ng",
});

doc.start = [
    "Example file for @thi.ng/iges",
    "Defines single open 2D polyline (type 106)"
];

iges.addPolyline2d(doc, [
    [0,0],
    [0, 100],
    [50, 150],
    [100, 100],
    [0, 100],
    [100, 0],
    [0, 0],
