## About

Extensible functional template engine for text document generation, incl. various high-level Markdown features.

This package evolved from this monorepo's readme generator toolchain and
currently is mainly used to generate all ~350 readme & changelog files in this
repo, but otherwise is **not** bound to this project in any way.

Please see
[`/tools/src/readme.ts`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/blob/develop/tools/src/readme.ts)
for a concrete usage example...
